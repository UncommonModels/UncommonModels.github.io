The Raritan River Railroad was a short line that ran from South Amboy, NJ to New Brunswick, NJ. The line was founded in 1888 and eventually was absorbed into Conrail in 1980. The line provided passenger service until 1938 and continues to service freight customers to the present day. Currently, only one original structure on the line survives: the Raritan River Railroad Freight Station in Milltown, NJ. The station originally served as the town's passenger station before being moved to its current location and repurposed as a freight depot. This model represents that station in it's current freight configuration, with wider doors on the track and road sides. To purchase a model in either HO scale or N Scale, please contact the Raritan River Railroad Historical Society. All proceeds go towards the moving of the station across the street so it can be restored and preserved as a museum and community meeting center.
