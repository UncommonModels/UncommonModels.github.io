title: "Free-Trak Standards"
subtitle: "**Version:** 0.9.1"
layout: default
---

Free-Trak is a proposed N scale module standard that combines the ease of use and "bulletproof" connections of T-Trak™ with the module sizing flexibility of Free-Mo. This increased flexibility aims to make modules easier to integrate into home layouts and lead to more operational interest for clubs.

**Preliminary Version Disclaimer:** Please note that these standards are not finalized and numbering/content is subject to change. Diagrams will be added soon. At version 1.0.0, all numbering shall be frozen

## Module Dimensions
1. All modules, with the exception of end modules (either balloon loop or stub-end), must have at least two endplates 
2. Modules may take any length and shape between endplates
3. Endplate widths must be between 6" (152mm) and 12" (305mm)
    1. Total module width between endplates may vary as desired by the builder
4. Endplates must be constructed so as not to significantly warp
5. Endplates must be 2 3/4" (70mm) tall with adjustable feet to maintain T-Trak™ compatibility
6. Endplates must included a centered slot for wiring 1/4" (6.35mm) above the bottom of the module, at minimum 1/2" (12.7mm) tall and 1" (25.4mm) wide


## Track Configuration
1. Track at each end plate should be either single or double track with Kato™ Unitrack™ connectors and centered within the end plate
2. Double track modules should use standard 33mm Kato™ Unitrack™ spacing
3. The minimum turnout shall be #6 for the through-route
4. The minimum through-route curve radius shall be 11" (282mm)
5. Tracks must overhang the endplate by no less than 0.1mm and no more than 1mm at each joint


## Wiring
1. Each double track module must be wired blue-white, white-blue (as described in the T-Trak™ standard)
2. Single track branch line endplates shall be labeled using blue and white indicators (paint, stickers, electrical tape, etc.) on the endplate to display polarity of each rail
3. Mini-Tamiya™ (standard Kato™) connectors shall be used, with one pair of feeders per track per module
    1. Optionally, a track power bus with Free-Mo style electrical connections with Anderson Powerpole™ connectors (as described in [Free-Mo Standard Section 4](http://www.free-mo.org/standard/#4)) may be implemented, with a clearly labeled double-pole, double throw (DPDT) switch allowing for the module to change between T-Trak™ and Free-Mo electrical operation modes
4. Auxillary power for accessories shall be either pulled from the track bus or a separate standard AC plug adapter


## Resolution of Ambiguities
1. Any ambiguities in the standards shall be resolved such that they maintain compatibility with T-Trak™ layouts


## Recommended Practices
1. 3/4" birch plywood or reinforced 1/4" birch plywood is for constructing endplates, see example endplate laser cutting templates [here](https://github.com/UncommonModels/Free-Trak-Templates)
2. Turnouts should be wired for operation via LCC
3. Crossovers should include an isolated reversing section to allow for switching mainline tracks when in T-Trak™ wiring mode
4. Use of a DCC system is strongly recommended
    1. Use of wireless throttles is strongly recommended
    2. Use of a DCC-EX based DCC system is recommended
