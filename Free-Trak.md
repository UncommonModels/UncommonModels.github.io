Free-Trak is a proposed N scale module standard that combines the ease of use and "bulletproof" connections of T-Trak with the module sizing flexibility of Free-MoN. This increased flexibility aims to make modules easier to integrate into home layouts and lead to more operational interest for clubs.

**Preliminary Version Disclaimer:** Please note that these standards are not finalized and numbering/content is subject to change. Diagrams will be added soon.

## Module Dimensions
1. All modules, with the exception of end modules (either baloon loop or stub-end), must have at least two endplates 
    1. Endplate width must be between 12" and 24"
    2. Endplates must be constructed of a non-warping material (3/4" birch plywood is recommended, see Free-Mo reccomended practices)
    3. Endplates must be labeled with a "front" corresponding to the rail attached to a blue feeder cable (see 3.1, note that this does not neccessarily need to be the intended viewing location of the module)
2. Modules may take any length and shape between endplates
3. Modules must be 2 3/4" tall with adjustable feet (to maintain T-Trak compatibility)


## Track Configuration
1. Track at each end plate should be either single or double track with Kato Unitrack connectors and centered within the end plate
2. Double track modules should use standard 33mm Kato track spacing
3. The minimum turnout shall be #6 for the mainline
4. The minimum curve radius shall be 11.25" (as in T-Trak)
5. Tracks must overhang the endplate by no more than 1mm at the joints


## Wiring
1. Each double track module must be wired blue-white, blue-white, with a front side of the module labeled corresponding to the blue rail. Note that this is different than the T-Trak standard, to allow for the use of crossovers without flipping one set of rails and causing confusion.
    1. Single track branch line endplates shall be labeled according to either the corresponding wiring for how it branches off a main line or such that the "front" of a module corresponds to the blue rail on a module with only single track endpoints
2. Andersen connectors shall be provided on each endplate, with one pair of blue and white connectors per track bus on the endplate
3. All main lines on the module must have at least one feeder connection to the track bus
4. Any balloon loops must be isolated from the main track and include an auto reversing circuit (to allow for use of crossovers on a double track main line)
5. Use of a DCC system is required
    1. Use of wireless throttles is strongly recommended
    2. Use of a DCC-EX based DCC system is recommended
