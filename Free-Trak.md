title: "Free-Trak Standards"
subtitle: "**Version:** 0.9.0"
layout: default
---

Free-Trak is a proposed N scale module standard that combines the ease of use and "bulletproof" connections of T-Trak™ with the module sizing flexibility of Free-MoN. This increased flexibility aims to make modules easier to integrate into home layouts and lead to more operational interest for clubs.

**Preliminary Version Disclaimer:** Please note that these standards are not finalized and numbering/content is subject to change. Diagrams will be added soon.

## Module Dimensions
1. All modules, with the exception of end modules (either balloon loop or stub-end), must have at least two endplates 
    1. Endplate width must be between 12" and 24"
    2. Endplates must be constructed of a non-warping material (3/4" birch plywood or reinforced 1/4" birch plywood is recommended, see Free-Mo recommended practices and example endplate laser cutting templates [here](https://github.com/UncommonModels/Free-Trak-Templates))
    3. Single track endplates must be labeled with a "front" corresponding to the rail attached to a blue feeder cable (see 3.1, note that this does not necessarily need to be the intended viewing location of the module)
2. Modules may take any length and shape between endplates
3. Modules must be 2 3/4" tall with adjustable feet (to maintain T-Trak™ compatibility)


## Track Configuration
1. Track at each end plate should be either single or double track with Kato™ Unitrack™ connectors and centered within the end plate
2. Double track modules should use standard 33mm Kato™ track spacing
3. The minimum turnout shall be #6 for the mainline
4. The minimum curve radius shall be 11.25" (as in T-Trak™)
5. Tracks must overhang the endplate by no less than 0.1mm and more than 1mm at each joint


## Wiring
1. Each double track module must be wired blue-white, white-blue (for T-Trak™ compatibility)
    1. Single track branch line endplates shall be labeled according to either the corresponding wiring for how it branches off a main line or such that the "front" of a module corresponds to the blue rail on a module with only single track endpoints
2. Andersen connectors shall be provided on each endplate, with one pair of blue and white connectors per track bus on the endplate


## Resolution of Ambiguities
1. Ambiguities in the standards shall be resolved such that they maintain compatibility with T-Trak™ layouts


## Recommended Practices
1. All main lines on the module are recommended to have at least one feeder connection to the track bus
2. Crossovers should include an isolated reversing section to allow for switching mainline tracks 
3. Use of a DCC system is strongly recommended
    1. Use of wireless throttles is strongly recommended
    2. Use of a DCC-EX based DCC system is recommended
